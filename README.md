## Overview of the school district analysis

The school board has notified Maria and her supervisor that the students_complete.csv file shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. Although the school board does not know the full extent of the academic dishonesty, they want to uphold state-testing standards and have turned to Maria for help.


### Purpose
To investigate and analysis the school district analysis that has replaced the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while keeping the rest of the data intact and how these changes affected the overall analysis.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions
